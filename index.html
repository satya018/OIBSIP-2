            <h3>Here's a time line of Virat Kohli's life:</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2002</strong> - In October, 13-year-old Virat is called up to the Delhi Under-15
                        team for the Polly Umrigar Trophy. He finishes the season as Delhi‚Äôs top scorer.</li>
                    <li><strong>2006</strong> - After impressing at the youth level for Delhi, Virat is selected
                        for the India Under-19 team for the first time and has a glorious tour of England,
                        averaging over a hundred in the one-day series.</li>
                    <li><strong>2008</strong> - Virat captained India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in
                        Malaysia, finishing the tournament as one of the top three run-getters. His natural
                        leadership skills caught the attention of all the right people.</li>
                    <li><strong>2008(June)</strong> - Still a teenager, Virat is signed by IPL franchise Royal
                        Challengers Bangalore on a youth contract for just Rs 12.5 lakhs.</li>
                    <li><strong>2008(August)</strong> - Virat was called up to the Indian ODI squad for the
                        first time, playing all 5 matches in an away series against Sri Lanka. He scored his
                        first half-century, an innings of 54, in game 4 of the series.</li>
                    <li><strong>2009</strong> - Virat had to wait a while to get back into the national team,
                        but it was worth it when he scored his maiden ODI century against Sri Lanka, 107 off 111
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2011</strong> - Virat played every single match of India‚Äôs successful 2011 World
                        Cup campaign, making his only century in the first game of the tournament against
                        Bangladesh. Though he didn‚Äôt really light up the tournament with his bat, his quote
                        about Sachin at the end of the tournament has gone down in cricketing folklore: ‚ÄúSachin
                        Tendulkar has carried the burden of the nation for 21 years. It is time we carried him
                        on our shoulders.‚Äù</li>
                    <li><strong>2011</strong> - Ask any cricketer what their aspiration is, and they will
                        universally say play Test cricket. Virat finally got the chance to make his Test debut
                        in 2011 against the West Indies, and unfortunately for the charismatic youngster, it was
                        a far-from-memorable occasion, making a grand total of 19 runs in the two innings he
                        played.</li>
                    <li><strong>2012</strong> - Kohli scored his first test hundred in rather spectacular
                        circumstances in the fourth and final test against Australia at Adelaide, narrowly
                        surviving getting run out when batting with Ishant Sharma, almost running out of
                        partners as well. His effort though failed to save India. We lost the series 4-0.</li>
                    <li><strong>2012</strong> - Virat played what is arguably one of the best ODI innings ever
                        by an Indian batsmen smashing 133 not out against Sri Lanka off just 86 balls to guide
                        India to the final of CB Series in Australia. India were chasing 321 and got to the
                        target in 37 overs as Hobart witnessed one of the greatest batting displays ever.</li>
                    <li><strong>2013</strong> - Virat was named stand-in ODI skipper for an injured MS Dhoni
                        when India toured the West Indies; earlier that year, he had also been appointed captain
                        of his IPL franchise, the Royal Challengers Bangalore.</li>
                    <li><strong>2014</strong> - Kohli got his first taste of Test captaincy when he was once
                        again asked to step in for an injured MS in Australia, and celebrated by scoring a
                        century in both innings in Adelaide. In what was a memorable </li>
                    <li><strong>2015</strong> - Having become a co-owner in ISL football club FC Goa the
                        previous year, Kohli extended his interest to tennis by also picking up stake in the
                        IPTL franchise, UAE Royals.</li>
                    <li><strong>2016</strong> - He played what was easily the best innings of his burgeoning
                        career as India beat Australia in Mohali to advance to the semi-finals of the ICC World
                        T20. His 82 off 51 balls was a classy effort, etched with timing and precision as
                        opposed to the lappa style of cricket one usually associates with 20 over cricket.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2017</strong>-Virat Kohli got the chance to captain in an ICC tournament for the first
                        time in the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. In the semi-final against Bangladesh, Kohli scored 96*,
                        thus becoming the fastest batsman, in terms of innings, to reach 8,000 runs in ODIs in 175
                        innings
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2018</strong>-Kohli became the 12th batsman and fastest player to score 10,000 ODI
                        runs.[245] He surpassed the milestone with 205 innings which is 54 innings less than the next
                        quickest to the landmark, Sachin Tendulkar.[246] In the course he scored his 37th ODI century.
                        On 27 October, after scoring his 38th ODI century, Kohli became the first batsman for India,
                        first captain and tenth overall, to score three successive centuries in ODIs. He ended up
                        scoring 453 runs in 5 innings, at an average of 151.00, in the 5-match series and was the Player
                        of the Series
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2019</strong>-In April 2019, he was named the captain of India's squad for the 2019
                        Cricket World Cup. On 16 June 2019, in India's match against Pakistan, Kohli became
                        the fastest batsman, in terms of innings, to score 11,000 runs in ODI cricket. He reached the
                        landmark in his 222nd innings. Eleven days later, in the match against the West Indies,
                        Kohli became the fastest cricketer, in terms of innings, to score 20,000 runs in international
                        cricket, doing so in his 417th innings. Kohli scored five consecutive fifty plus score in
                        the tournament. India lost the semi-final against New Zealand, in which Kohli was out for just a
                        run.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2020</strong>-In November 2020, Kohli was nominated for the Sir Garfield Sobers Award
                        for ICC Male Cricketer of the Decade, as well as Test, ODI and T20I player of the decade. He won
                        the awards for Male cricketer of the decade and ODI cricketer of the decade.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2021</strong>- T20 World Cup and Retirement from captaincy across all formats
                        In September 2021, Kohli was named as the captain of India's squad for the 2021 ICC Men's T20
                        World Cup Kohli also announced that he would step down as T20I captain after T20 World
                        Cup, India could not make it throughs the semi-final, which was the first time in
                        the 9 years In December 2021, Kohli was replaced by Rohit Sharma as India's ODI captain.
                        BCCI President Sourav Ganguly later explained the decision to drop Kohli as ODI captain by
                        saying that the selectors did not feel right to have two white ball captains.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2022</strong>-Virat Kohli made his return to form in Asia Cup 2022, scoring 276 runs

                        first game against Pakistan, Kohli scored 82* and won the match for his team by a close
                        margin. He rated this as his best innings in the format due to the magnitude which the game
                        had.Kohli ended up as the highest run scorer in the tournament, with 296 runs, including 4
                        fifties .
